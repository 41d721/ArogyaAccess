Aarogya Access
We believe in,‚Äù Enhancing healthcare accessibility, regardless of geographic barriers."
Arogya Access is a user-friendly telehealth platform that facilitates seamless communication between patients in rural areas and doctors located in urban areas. The platform offers a range of features tailored to overcome the unique obstacles faced by rural communities, including fragile trust, language barriers, patchy connectivity and disjointed infrastructure.
We combat these obstacles by providing a platform for the patients to interact with the doctors. Through our platform the doctors can guide the health authorities of the region to perform the required treatment in medical emergencies. We also provide access to required offline data  to the health authorities in rural areas to carry on with the treatment when connectivity is lost. Also in case of unavailibility of Specialised Doctors there is provision of ChatBot which will guide the authorities.
